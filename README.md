# Observatorium

This is the result of a two day group project during the introduction to programming class at CIID.
One person coding the Processing sketch and one coding the P5js sketch.

# Processing

The processing sketch is sending midi data a midi software (Ableton Live, Garageband â€¦) running on you localhost. 
In order to do that you need to setup a midi IAC Driver with the name "Bus 1" on your localhost.

An the other hand it is listening on the port 3200 for OSC messages, that way it can be connected 

The main class is ObservatoriumSketch.

**Dependencies**
- Processing Core
- Processing Serial
- controlIP5
- oscP5
- klang

# Node OSC Forward Server

Forwards http data received at port 3000 as OSC message to port 3200 on localhost.

# P5js

If th enode server is running this can be run from a seperate computer and sent celestial objects to the universe or rotate the universe.

# Arduino Knob

A very simple small sketch to turn the universe in the Processing sketch.
In order to run this the **ArduinoPotSerial** needs to be running.
