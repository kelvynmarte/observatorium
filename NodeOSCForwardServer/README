Now go to https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and download and install node. Once you've installed node, navigate to the folder in the terminal and run the following command:

npm install --save

this will create a node-libraries folder that has all the libraries you need to run the node application

After you've installed the node libraries, then type:

node itp_p5_bridge.js

This will allow your p5 counterpart to connect to your server. You'll also need to tell them the name of your machine, you can find this in the System Preferences -> Sharing

Your p5 counterpart will then edit their html file and sketch.js file to access your server at <YourMachine>.local:3000

Have fun!
